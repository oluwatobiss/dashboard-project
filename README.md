# Dashboard

Here is a dashboard for an imaginary user (Morgan Oakley) who uses it to update himself on the latest [CodeSweetly](https://codesweetly.com) activities.

I used this project to get better with CSS Grid Layout Module.

Feel free to [use the app here](https://oluwatobiss.github.io/dashboard-project).

Also, check out my articles at [CodeSweetly](https://codesweetly.com) and the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/oluwatobi).

**Note:**

This project is part of my [WEB DEVELOPMENT](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) training at The Odin Project.
